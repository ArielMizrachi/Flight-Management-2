# Launch
- for the back part you need to add .env file in that file you will need to define the following:
MONGO_URI = mongo_url
JWT_SECRET = Secret
JWT_SECRET_REFRESH = Secret_refresh
- after that just use 
npm i 
npm start 

- for the front part write
npm i
npm start
# Project status
The project is operational but is still a demo for learning to code, I inted to clean the code and add aditional feature later
